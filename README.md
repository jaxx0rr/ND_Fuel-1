# ND Fuel Script for qb-core

This is a modified version of ND Fuel script for qb-core with Jerry Can support.

Open issue for any feature requests or issues obviously.

Original Creator : https://github.com/Andyyy7666


## QB-Core integration:
use VS Code to mass replace "LegacyFuel" with "ND_Fuel" (use "open folder" -> "resources" and click on the magnifying glass)
do this preferably before placing ND_Fuel into resources although only the readme file will be affected..
